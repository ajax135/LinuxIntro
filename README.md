Linux Fundamentals
=====================

This project aims to provide fundamental knowledge for a person new to the Linux environment. 

# Organization

The organization of the project is folder based. The course material, written in markdown, exists in the *markdown* directory. Built files ready for distribution belong in the *dist* folder. The *buildMDToC.py* creates a table of contents for a markdown file based on the heading markers. 

# Course Module Structure

Each module consists of three parts. The first portion provides the lecture and basic knowledge behind the topic; when practical, it also provides a live demonstration. The second portion gives students a task to accomplish as the instructor provides real-time feedback to students with questions or problems. The final part of a module gives students a task that incorporates the main topic and encourages critical thinking skills, ideally without instructor assistance.
