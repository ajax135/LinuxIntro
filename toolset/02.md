### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to introduce the Command Line Interface.  This includes the history, technical differentations, and typical environments.

#### 1. What is a shell?

> A shell is an interface offering limited, well-defined access to core services. (2)

Okay, so that makes almost every user interface for a computer system a shell?  Yes.  Context is important.  Most of the time, you can assume shell means a command line interface between you and your operating system. But techincally GNOME/KDE/Unity are GUI shell's too. 

But then what is a "terminal" or a "console"?

> terminal = tty = text input/output environment
> console = physical terminal
> shell = command line interpreter (3)

#### 2. TTY's
Terminals have an interesting historical basis for understanding how they work today. Take a few moments to skim [The TTY demystified](http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/) (stop at Processes) (4)

#### 3. Command Line Usage

Some command line skills and nomenclature translate across all operating systems:

* Prompt - Provides context for the user, indicates the interface is ready for input
* Command - the application to run (client specified)
* Parameters - arguments or options provided to the command (client specified)

Consider the following usage line (unix):

  `user@host:dir$ command -[o] [-r <param>] [-l <item1>[,item2,...]] thing && command2`

The first part of the line givens some information about the logged in user. It displays the user name and the computer hostname. In most systems, *dir* represents the full path to the current working directory. `$` is the prompt terminator for a normal user; `#` terminates a prompt for a user with sudo privileges. Brackets "[ ]" represent optional arguments. Angled brackets "< >" represent required arguments. Some programs omit the "< >" as in the case of *thing* above.

> `-o`in:inoptional argument. The program will choose a default value if it is not included.   
> `-r <param>`is:isoptional argument. When using this option, a *param* is expected. The program will throw an error if no *param* is given.  
> `-l <item1>[,item2,...]]`item2:item2optional argument. This argument expects at least one *item* to be passed. However, additional items *may* be passed if separated by a ",".  
> `thing`passed:passedrequired argument. The program will fail if this argument is omitted.  
> `&&`fail:failin this context, acts as a separator between two commands. `command2` will only execute if `command` exited without an error.

In most instances, single-character arguements (such as `-o`, `-r`, and `-l` above) will have a single "-" in front of them to denote an option. Multi-character arguments (such as `--option` and `--long-option`) use "--" as the option marker. Options can be mixed in multiple orders, and most can be used together. A semicolon `;` can be used to separate multiple commands on the same line. 


Use wikipedia's [CLI Usage section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface#Usage) to answer the following questions:

> What is the traditional mechanism for providing parameter options identifiers (flags) in unix?

> What does it mean when a unix CLI promt ends with `#`?

#### 4. Unix shells

`sh` is both Shell Command Language and more typically the Bourne Shell is a command line interpreter for unix.  Shell Command Language is the programming language described by the POSIX standard. The Bourne Shell (along with many others is an implementation of this standard. (5)

`bash` is short for the Bourne-again Shell.  It also is a decription for it's creation intent: to "bashing all the features of sh together with many of those from both csh and ksh". (6)  bash is a superset of Bourne shell meaning that scripts that were written for `sh` could run in `bash` without modification. 

#### 5. More shells

* `ksh` - [Korn Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korn_shell)
* `csh` - [C Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_shell)
* `zsh` - [Z Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)
