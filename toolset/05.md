### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to introduce creating and viewing text files in unix

#### 1. File editors

0. Skim the man pages for these popular CLI editors

    * `$` `man nano`
    * `$` `man pico`
    * `$` `man vi`
    * `$` `man vim`
    * `$` `man emacs`

0. Choose an editor (nano is the most like Notepad) and create a file with some content in it.  Make sure the file has at least 30 lines in it and each line is unique. Write the file to `~/firstlevel/secondlevel/test`

#### 2. Displaying files

0. Read the `less` man page and the help summary

    `$` `man less`
    
    `$` `less --help`
    
    > You can start using the COMMANDS while reading, remember man opens the text file manuals with `less`

0. Open our newly created file with less

    `$` `less ~/firstlevel/secondlevel/test`

#### 3. Working with files

You may be interested in a specific section of very large or continually changing files.  This is where `tail` and `head` become useful.

0. Read the `head` and `tail` man pages
    
    `$` `man head`

    `$` `man tail`

    > How would you use `tail` to watch the last changed contents of a file that is appended to over time (i.e. a log file)?

0. Display our newly created file with `head` and `tail`

    `$` `head ~/firstlevel/secondlevel/test`

    `$` `tail ~/firstlevel/secondlevel/test`

0. Read the `cat` man page

    `$` `man cat`

0. Write our newly created into the Standard Out buffer with `cat`

    `$` `cat ~/firstlevel/secondlevel/test`

0. Bonus: Read [The Useless Use of Cat Award](http://porkmail.org/era/unix/award.html#cat)
