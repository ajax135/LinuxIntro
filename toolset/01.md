### Lab Objective

The objective of this lab is to introduce the coreutils software.  For a introductory experience these are the tangiable and pervasive interfaces that a user with find similar across most unix-like systems.

#### 1. GNU Core Utilities

We will dive into the command line soon, but first we need to talk about what most people actually asociate with what Unix like systems are.  When a sysadmin sits down and begins administering a system they expect a standard set of tools to accomplish their work.  Core Utilities, or coreutils for shor are those tools.

Just like physical tools, you can use and abuse these tools to get almost any job done. Having the right tool for the job often does make it much easier though.  This is why it is useful to review, even for experts, the list of all the coreutils and know what is available to you.

View the coreutils list linked below.  Look for familar commands and click and read some that are unfamiliar.

> What command did you not know about before?

> When could this command be useful?

> What commands have you used in the past that aren't on this list?

#### 2. Common command line flags

Because coreutils follow similar conventions we can learn a few useful flags that should work across all coreutils applications (and usually other programs too). (1)

> `--help` Print a usage message listing all available options, then exit successfully.

> `--version` Print the version number, then exit successfully.
